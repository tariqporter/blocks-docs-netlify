          Tooltips typically are triggered by hovering/focusing or by clicking. This must be specified for each instance. Triggering by hover should be limited as this implementation doesnâ€™t work for touch devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tooltips that are triggered by hover or focus should disappear when focus shifts or the user mouses away from the target.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tooltips that are triggered by clicking should disappear when the user clicks away from the tooltip.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tooltips should be brief. They should not contain rich information like images or buttons.
